David Concord Homework 2 RGB slider
This program will allow a user to use 3 color slide bars to create a custom color and save it in a list. I ran into some trouble, mostly saving the color in the array. I had no problem saving the text,
but could not figure out how to save the color in each position. I figured out that I was not using the custom cell the way that I should have and once I figured that out I was okay. That is the one main issue that I had. I spent roughly 75% of my time trying
to figure that alone out.
